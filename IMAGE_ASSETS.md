## Temporary Placeholder

Until you add the actual images, the components will show gradient backgrounds as placeholders. The layout and functionality will work perfectly once you add the images.

## Image Optimization Tips

- Use WebP format for better performance
- Optimize images before uploading (compress to reduce file size)
- Use appropriate dimensions to avoid unnecessary large files
- Next.js Image component will automatically optimize and serve the images
